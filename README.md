# Angle-Detector
This is a file that contains the angle detector code which can detect the angle between two lines just using simple maths.
Here we need to add 3 points, initially the point joining the two lines then the two other points.
It shows the angle right after the 3 points are appended in the list and shows the angle on degrees.
